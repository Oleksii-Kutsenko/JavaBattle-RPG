# Mini Text-Based RPG Battle Simulator

## Description:
Create a text-based RPG battle simulator in Java. This project will allow you to practice object-oriented programming, complex logic, and game mechanics.

## Features:

1. Character Creation: Allow the user to create a character by choosing a class (e.g., warrior, mage, rogue) and assigning attributes like health and attack power.
2. Enemy Encounters: Generate random enemy encounters with varying attributes (health, attack power).
3. Turn-Based Battle System: Implement a turn-based battle system where the player and enemy take turns attacking each other.
4. Attack Actions: Define different attack actions based on the character class (e.g., physical attack, spellcasting).
5. Health Management: Update character and enemy health after each attack and display the current health during battles.
6. Battle Outcome: Determine the winner of the battle based on who defeats their opponent first.
7. Scoring: Keep track of the number of battles won and lost by the player.

## Steps:

1. Design: Plan the classes and attributes needed for characters, enemies, and the battle system.
2. Character Creation: Allow the player to choose a class and set attributes accordingly.
3. Enemy Generation: Create a mechanism to randomly generate enemy encounters.
4. Battle Loop: Implement a loop that continues until either the player or the enemy wins.
5. Attack Logic: Define attack actions for different character classes and implement the logic for attacks and health management.
6. Display: Show relevant information during battles, such as health, attacks, and outcomes.
7. Scoring and Tracking: Keep track of the player's wins and losses.
